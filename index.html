                    <h4>Summer 2017</h4>
                    <p>In the summer of 2017 I had a nine week summer internship with Liquidnet, a fin-tech company that does algorithmic trading. I created an application to ping their main striker program for subscription data. This would then be deployed to help troubleshoot. Before, if a subscribers data became inaccurate the developers would have to read through many log files to figure out the problem. With my program, developers could simply ping an individual subscription and then get the data back for one instead of looking through them all. To develop my application, I built a client application that acted as a subscriber so I could send test subscriptions and get their data back. This project was in java, but I also gained exposure to Javascript HTML and CSS while having to design lesson plans for Liquidnet's Tech for Girlsrogram where we explored the tech world with high schools girls.</p>

                    <p>I spent two terms working for Professor Kotz, a Dartmouth Computer Science Faculty Member, at his lab called The Amulet Group.  The Amulet Group researchs stress through wearable devices. I designed and implemented an undershirt that used peak detection to calculate the occurrence of R waves in the wearer's heart beat. An ECG Shield on an Arduino was used to calculate and obtain the data. It then would go through my peak detection algorithm written in Arduino, a language similar to C. The program would wirelessly send the results of the time between these R waves using a XBee Shield. This shirt was important because RR interval is a key way to measure stress which is what Professor Kotz and the Amulet group research.</p>

                    <p>To enhance my engineering knowledge I spent my junior year summer in high school working for the Naval Submarine Medical Research Lab in New London Connecticut. I was tasked with creating an interactive poster that would alert the men on the submarines to high noise levels that could be in their area. This project used a microphone to process sound, Arduino for calculations and LED lights to display the output. After working for the subbase, I was so excited by this project that I continued to do an independent study in Arduino and updated my poster to be able to send text messages depending on loudness.</p>

                            <p>This java program for Computer Science 10 created a version of the Kevin Bacon. To play this game, the user enters the name of the person and the computer calculates how many connections it would take to get to Kevin Bacon. <a href="annikakouhia.github.com" target="_blank">Annika Kouhia</a> and I replicated this game by inputting a file with movies and actors and then using graphs to keep track of the actor's relationships. The code was then able to search for the shortest path through the graph from the entered person to Kevin Bacon and return that number.</p>

                            <p>After studying algorithms <a href="annikakouhia.github.com" target="_blank">Annika Kouhia</a> and I replicated Dijkstra's Algorithm in Java for Computer Science 10. We created a code that learned from sample sentences and then determine the parts of speech from new sentences we entered. It did this by reading in files to start the part of speech tagging and then created a graph with this information. The graph had weighted edges just like in Dijkstra's and we used the weights to calculate the likelihood a word to be a particular part of speech. This lab explored maps, graphs and sets.</p>

                            <p>For computer science 50 (Software Design and Implementation) I created a tiny search engine. This search engine could be used on the Dartmouth server. It was written in C with data structures such as maps, sets, and more that I wrote myself. My tiny search engine consisted of a crawler, indexer and querier which would be run together to allow the user to query for a topic and get many website recommendations back. </p>

                            <p>In my final project for Computer Science 50 my assigned group of three and I created a game in C using a pebble watch, server and client. In the game, users ran around campus and found clues called KRAGs. The KRAGs each had a code and the user would enter the code into their pebble which would communicate with the server. The players of the game also had a player acting as mission control who sent out hints. Creating this client was my specific role in the project.</p>
